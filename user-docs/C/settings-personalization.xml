	<title>Settings - Personalization</title>

	<para>Similar to other desktop or mobile operating systems, Xubuntu comes with a default look and feel that some users will prefer to customize to their needs. Unlike Windows, Mac OS and some Linux desktop environments, Xubuntu comes pre-installed with many customization tools that give users a lot of control.</para>

	<para>Xubuntu’s customization settings can be accessed from the <guilabel>Personal</guilabel> category of the &settings2;, the <guilabel>Settings</guilabel> category of the application &appmenu; <guibutton>Menu</guibutton> (Ctrl + Escape), <guibutton>Application Finder</guibutton> (Alt + F3), or the right-click menu of an object.</para>

			<para>For other changes to panel(s), you will need to open the <guibutton>Panel</guibutton> settings dialog, which is also accessible by right-clicking on any of the panel items and selecting <guilabel>Panel -> Panel Preferences...</guilabel>. The top section of the dialog gives access to open the <guibutton>Panel Profiles</guibutton> settings dialog and the ability to select, add and remove panels. The remainder of settings are broken up across three tabs.</para>

			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem><para><guibutton>Display</guibutton> - On this tab, you can set the panel’s width and height, vertical or horizontal orientation, position on the screen, and hiding behaviour. To move the panel, you will need to uncheck the <guilabel>Lock panel</guilabel> checkbox and drag it by one of the two handles that appear on either side.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para><guibutton>Appearance</guibutton> - On this tab, you can set the panel’s transparency, icon size and whether its background is a color or image.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para><guibutton>Items</guibutton> - This tab allows you to add, arrange, and remove plugins, as well as access plugin properties through the button bar. It is also possible to rearrange items by dragging with the mouse, and access properties by double-clicking.</para></listitem>
			</itemizedlist>

			<para>It is possible to install additional panel plugins, also known as panel applets. Panel plugins not listed in the <guilabel>Add New Items</guilabel> dialog will need to be installed before they can be used. Some of the plugins are <ulink url="https://docs.xfce.org/xfce/xfce4-panel/start#external_plugins">listed here</ulink> and the more popular/useful ones are for clipboard management (<ulink url="apt://xfce4-clipman-plugin">install</ulink>), global menu (<ulink url="apt://xfce4-appmenu-plugin">install</ulink>), etc.</para>

			<para>Users who want a dock similar to the one found on Mac OS and elementary OS can choose from these docks - Plank (<ulink url="apt://plank">install</ulink>), DockbarX (<ulink url="https://launchpad.net/~xuzhen666/+archive/ubuntu/dockbarx">PPA</ulink>), Docky, or Cairo Dock. Users who want a Windows 7-like taskbar with window list buttons can install the DockbarX (<ulink url="https://launchpad.net/~xuzhen666/+archive/ubuntu/dockbarx">PPA</ulink>) or Docklike (<ulink url="https://launchpad.net/~xubuntu-dev/+archive/ubuntu/extras">PPA</ulink>) panel plugins.

			<para>Once the <guibutton>Desktop</guibutton> settings dialog is launched, the <guilabel>Background</guilabel> tab gives you options to choose between a wallpaper image, a color gradient, a single color, or a combination of wallpaper(s) and color(s) as the desktop background.</para>

			<para>When choosing an image as the background from the wallpaper list, you may choose from the default selection that comes with Xubuntu or select an image from a different folder by changing the <guilabel>Folder</guilabel> dropdown. You have the option to set how the wallpaper will fit on the screen in the <guilabel>Style</guilabel> dropdown. The default is <guilabel>Zoomed</guilabel>, which resizes the image preserving its aspect ratio and cropping the image to fill the screen. If you have multiple monitors connected, then the dropdown will also have a <guilabel>Spanning screens</guilabel> entry, to stretch the wallpaper the displays.</para>

			<para>If there are multiple images in the wallpaper list, you also have the option to set the background to automatically cycle through them in an ordered or random sequence. By enabling the <guilabel>Change the background</guilabel> checkbox, you have several time-based options to choose from. The last option, <guilabel>Chronologically</guilabel>, sets the wallpapers to appear over evenly timed periods of a day.</para>

			<note><para>The default selection of wallpapers shipped with Xubuntu includes wallpapers created by the Xubuntu team for different releases and wallpapers submitted by the community. For more community contest-winning wallpapers, search for the packages that begin with xubuntu-community-wallpapers in the <guibutton>Synaptic</guibutton> package manager.</para></note>

			<para>To set the background as a single color or a two-color gradient, set <guilabel>Style</guilabel> to ‘None’ and then set <guilabel>Color</guilabel> to the appropriate entry. You can then click on the color buttons next to the dropdown list to open the <guilabel>Select Color</guilabel> dialog. You have the option to select from the list of color presets, right-click on a color preset to customize that color, or create a custom color from scratch by pressing the plus button.</para>

			<para>If you have multiple workspaces, also known as virtual desktops, you can choose to have the same background appear across all workspaces or use a different background for each workspace. To use a different background, uncheck the <guilabel>Apply to all workspaces</guilabel> checkbox,then move the dialog to each workspace individually and select a different background. This can be done by dragging the window to the left or right corners of the screen or pressing the keyboard shortcuts Ctrl + Alt + Home or Ctrl + Alt + End. This also is the case when you have multiple monitors connected, where each display will have the default wallpaper unless the window is dragged to other displays and the background is changed.</para>

		<title>Theming</title>

		<para>A desktop theme is used to change the look and feel of the GUI (Graphical User Interface) and can consist of many things, including the desktop wallpaper, user interface styling and colors, fonts, icons, and sounds. In Xubuntu, you may change many of these individual components, so your desktop can be as unique as you like it to be.</para>

		<para>The three main theming components that you should know about are:</para>
