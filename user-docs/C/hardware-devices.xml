	<title>Hardware devices</title>

	<para>Your computer consists of a number of connected devices collectively known as computer hardware.</para>

	<para>Xubuntu normally configures your hardware automatically, but there may be occasions when you need to make changes to hardware settings yourself. This section provides information on tools which can be used to configure your hardware.</para>

		<title>Restricted drivers</title>

		<section id="restricted-why">
			<title>Why are some drivers restricted?</title>

			<para>Restricted drivers are drivers for your hardware that are not freely available or open source.</para>

			<para>Most of the devices (hardware) attached to your computer should function properly in Xubuntu. These devices are likely to have unrestricted drivers, which means that the drivers can be modified by the Xubuntu developers and problems with them can be fixed.</para>

			<para>Some hardware does not have unrestricted drivers, usually because the hardware manufacturer has not released details of their hardware that would make it possible to create such a driver. These devices may have limited functionality or may not work at all.</para>
		</section>

		<section id="restricted-enabling">
			<title>Enabling restricted drivers</title>

			<para>If a restricted driver is available for a certain device, it can be installed in order to allow your device to function properly, or to add new features. For example, installing a restricted driver for certain graphics cards may allow you to use more advanced visual effects.</para>

			<para>Some computers may not have any devices that can use restricted drivers, either because all of the devices are fully supported by unrestricted drivers or because no restricted drivers are yet available for the device.</para>

			<para>If any drivers are available for your hardware they will be installable from the <application>Software and Updates</application> application:</para>

			<title>Disabling restricted drivers</title>

			<para>If a restricted driver is causing problems, or you would just like to turn it off, follow the procedure below:</para>

		<section id="disks-partitions-check-free-space">
			<title>Checking how much disk space is available</title>

		<section id="disks-partitions-mounting">
			<title>Mounting and unmounting devices</title>

			<para>When you connect a removable storage device to your computer, it must be mounted by the operating system so that you are able to access the files on the device.</para>

			<para>To find out how to mount and unmount storage devices manually and/or automatically, see the Ubuntu community wiki page for the <ulink url="&communitywiki-mount;">mount command</ulink>.</para>

			<para>When you copy files to a removable storage device, they are not always written to the device immediately. Instead, they are often stored in a queue so that they can all be transferred across to the device at the same time (for reasons of efficiency). Running the command <userinput>sync</userinput> can force pending data to be written to removable storage devices. If you disconnect the device before all of the files have been transferred, you could lose the files. To prevent this, you must always unmount a removable device before disconnecting it.</para>

		<section id="laptops-touchpads">
			<title>Touchpads</title>

			<para>Most laptop computers come with a touchpad, which is used to control the mouse pointer. There are many ways of changing the way that the touchpad behaves; the most basic touchpad settings can be configured in the following way:</para>

			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem><para>Go to &wm-settings-mouse-touchpad;</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>From the <guilabel>Device:</guilabel> field pick list, select the touchpad.</para></listitem>

		<title>Suspending and Hibernating</title>

		<para>In order to save power, you can put your computer into one of a number of power-saving modes when you are not using it:</para>

		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem><para>Suspending a computer is like putting the computer to sleep. The computer will still be turned on and all of your work will be left open, but it will use much less power. You can wake the computer by pressing a key or clicking the mouse.</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>Hibernating is turning the computer off completely while saving the current state of the computer (such as keeping all of your open documents). When you turn the computer back on after hibernating, all of your work should be restored as it was before hibernation. No power is used when the computer is hibernating.</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>Resuming is bringing the computer out of a power saving mode and back into normal operation. You can resume the computer from being suspended by pressing a keyboard button or by clicking the mouse. You can resume from hibernation by pressing the power button on your computer. </para></listitem>
		</itemizedlist>

		<note><para>Note that hibernate is disabled by default in Xubuntu and does not appear as an option in any menus. For a command line workaround, see <xref linkend="enabling-hibernation"/>.</para></note>

		<para>You can manually put your computer into a power-saving mode by pressing &wm-logout; and then pressing the appropriate button.</para>

		<note><para>Some computers may have problems going into certain power-saving modes. The best way of checking if your computer can handle a power-saving mode is to try to switch to that mode and see if it behaves as you expected. Always make sure you save important documents before suspending or hibernating.</para></note>

		<section id="suspending-troubleshooting">
			<title>My computer doesn't suspend or hibernate correctly</title>

			<para>Some computers are unable to suspend or hibernate correctly with Xubuntu. If this is the case for your computer, you may notice some of the following symptoms:</para>

			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem><para>The computer does not turn off after you click to hibernate it.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>When you turn the computer on after hibernating it, your previously open programs are not restored.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>The computer will not wake up after you have suspended it.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>Certain programs or hardware devices stop working correctly after resuming from hibernation or waking-up from being suspended.</para></listitem>
			</itemizedlist>

			<para>If you suffer from any of these problems, you should report a bug to <ulink url="&launchpad-web;">Launchpad</ulink>. The problems will hopefully be fixed in a subsequent version of Xubuntu. If your hardware does not work properly after suspending or hibernating your computer, restart your computer and it should return to normal. If a program does not work properly, try closing the program and then starting it again.</para>

			<warning><para>Make sure that you save all of your open documents before testing for suspend and hibernate problems.</para></warning>

		<section id="suspending-patterns">
			<title>I get strange patterns on the screen when I hibernate my computer</title>

			<para>Your screen may show a black and white pattern just after you click to hibernate your computer. This is usually nothing to worry about and is just how the graphics cards of some computers respond to the initial stages of the hibernation process. If the computer displays the pattern for a prolonged period of time without turning itself off then you may have a problem with hibernation.
