        <p>Security updates are very important. They are the best defense you have against the people who want to harm your computer, and you should install them immediately. When a security update is released, hackers already know how to abuse computers that are not up-to-date. In the worst case scenario, they are searching for victims to hack with automated programs in under a few hours.</p>
        <p>Automatic security updates are enabled by default in Xubuntu. If you
			want to change the settings for the automatic updates, go to the
			<em class="guilabel">Updates</em> tab under <span class="application"><strong><span class="guiicon"><span class="inline-icon-menu"><img src="../libs/images/icon_menu.png" /></span></span> → <span class="guimenuitem">Settings Manager</span> → <span class="guimenuitem">Software &amp; Updates</span></strong></span> and change
			the settings to your liking.</p>

              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>Using strong and unique passwords for important and sensitive accounts helps prevent unauthorized access to your personal information, identity theft and direct financial losses. Consider the following scenario:</p>
          <div class="orderedlist">
            <ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
              <li class="listitem">
                <p>Alice uses identical passwords for mytrustedbank.com and insecureblog.com</p>
              </li>
              <li class="listitem">
                <p>insecureblog is hacked and Alice’s information and password are stolen</p>
              </li>
              <li class="listitem">
                <p>Hackers can now access Alice’s bank account and steal her money</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </div>
          <p>Password reuse can turn into a disaster. You should pay attention to use unique and strong passwords for the following services:</p>
          <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
              <li class="listitem">
                <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Email accounts</em></span>. Email accounts can be used to reset all your other passwords via the “Forgotten password” links found on all websites.</p>

              <li class="listitem">
                <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Key stores and password managers</em></span>. It is worth having a good password for those services, since they allow you to avoid typing many other passwords!</p>

                <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Accounts related to banking</em></span>, including PayPal and other payment sites. If someone can access these, they can steal your money.</p>
              </li>

                <h3 class="title"><a id="passwords-strong"></a>What is a strong password?</h3>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>The strength of a password depends on how hard it is for an attacker to guess it. Attackers use special programs that can make millions of guesses per second, so weak passwords don’t stand a chance.</p>
          <p>Some passwords (like <code class="literal">monkey</code>, <code class="literal">password</code>, <code class="literal">test</code>, <code class="literal">123456</code>) are extremely common. If you use those common passwords, your accounts will be hacked easily. However, adding capital letters, numbers or symbols is often not enough to turn a weak password into a strong one. This is because people reliably pick the same additional symbols and numbers (for instance, <code class="literal">monkey1</code> is more common than <code class="literal">mo5nkey</code>, and also more common than <code class="literal">monkey hoover</code>).</p>
          <p>It is better to choose a longer secret, such as a pass phrase (for example <code class="literal">correct horse stable battery</code>), than a secret that is both hard to remember and easy to crack. Consider using a series of common words which you can easily remember. Do not pick words that people around you would naturally associate with you (for instance, you should not pick poker related words if you play poker every day).</p>

          <p>While using the same password for multiple accounts is not encouraged, everybody ends up doing this, even security experts. However, many commonly used websites get compromised by hackers every year. Some of them might even purposefully sell their users' passwords to third-parties. There is no definitive agreement among security researchers on how to reduce the risk of reusing passwords, but you should consider the following:</p>
          <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
              <li class="listitem">

              <li class="listitem">
                <p>Use a password you're willing to lose for sites you do not trust.</p>

            </ul>

          <p>You don’t need to change your passwords every other day. In many cases, if an attacker can steal your password, they will be able to steal it again in the future.</p>
          <p>If you do need to change your password, you must pick one that is <span class="emphasis"><em>actually</em></span> different from the previous one. For example, <code class="literal">monkey5</code> is not an acceptable substitute for <code class="literal">monkey4</code>, and it will be easily guessed by an attacker who already stole your previous password!</p>

          <p>If you run public facing Internet services, or are not on a NAT, you should consider using a firewall. Most home users are not concerned by this measure.</p>
          <p>Understand that firewalls are not very useful in their default settings. You should consider what you want to achieve and configure the firewall accordingly. Firewalls can protect you against denial of service attacks, limit access to a service to specific IP addresses or inspect and reject suspicious packets. However, they cannot protect you against unknown or emerging threats, and they do not replace the need to install security updates.</p>

        </div>
        <p>A problem that you may occasionally encounter is the unexpected loss of some of your work and settings for one reason or another. The causes of such data loss are many and varied; they could be anything from a power failure to accidentally deleting a file. It is highly recommended that you make regular backup copies of your important files so that, if you do encounter a problem, you will not have lost those files.</p>
        <p>It is wise to store backup copies of files separately from your computer; that is, you should make use of some form of file storage which is not permanently attached to your computer. Options include but are not limited to writable CDs and DVDs, external hard disks, USB disks and other computers on the network.</p>
        <p>A simple way of backing up your files is to manually copy them to a safe location (see above) by using the <span class="application"><strong>File Browser</strong></span> as well as the <span class="application"><strong>Archive Manager</strong></span> which lets you compress files and pack them together. Alternatively, you can use a dedicated backup application.</p>
        <p>General advice on how to keep good backups:</p>
